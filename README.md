Hi! I am Manan Gangwani. I like creating cool apps and games. I'm fascinated with the world of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. Apart from coding, I love doodling, sportz and playing the guitar.

I have made many games from a Piano Octave simulator to a Maze runner. I use Visual Studio Code and React Native in snack to create apps and games. 

On my GitHub you will find cool stuff related to mobile app development, web development and coding in Java and Python.
