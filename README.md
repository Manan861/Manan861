Hi! I am Manan Gangwani. I like creating cool apps and games. I'm fascinated with the world of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. In my free time I love doodling, drawing and playing the guitar.

I have made many games from a Piano Octave simulator to a Maze runner game. I use Visual Studio Code and React Native in snack to create such apps and games.
